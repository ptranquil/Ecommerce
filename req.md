reating a complete e-commerce system involves implementing various APIs to handle different aspects of the system, including products, user authentication, shopping carts, orders, and integrating Elasticsearch for search functionality. Below is a list of APIs you might consider implementing for a basic e-commerce flow using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you might need to handle more features and considerations.

Product APIs:

Create a new product: POST /api/products
Get a list of all products: GET /api/products
Get details of a specific product: GET /api/products/:productId
Update a product: PUT /api/products/:productId
Delete a product: DELETE /api/products/:productId
User Authentication APIs:

User registration: POST /api/users/register
User login: POST /api/users/login
Get user details: GET /api/users/:userId (authenticated)
Update user details: PUT /api/users/:userId (authenticated)
User logout: POST /api/users/logout (authenticated)
Shopping Cart APIs:

Add a product to the cart: POST /api/cart/add/:productId (authenticated)
Get the contents of the cart: GET /api/cart (authenticated)
Update the quantity of a product in the cart: PUT /api/cart/update/:productId (authenticated)
Remove a product from the cart: DELETE /api/cart/remove/:productId (authenticated)
Order APIs:

Place an order: POST /api/orders/place (authenticated)
Get order history: GET /api/orders/history (authenticated)
Get details of a specific order: GET /api/orders/:orderId (authenticated)
Cancel an order: DELETE /api/orders/cancel/:orderId (authenticated)
Elasticsearch Integration:

Index products in Elasticsearch: Triggered on product creation/update
Search products: GET /api/search?q=keyword
Implement autocomplete suggestions: GET /api/suggest?q=partialKeyword
Elasticsearch Integration Details:

Use the official elasticsearch library for Node.js to interact with Elasticsearch.
When creating or updating a product, index the product data in Elasticsearch.
Implement search functionality by querying Elasticsearch based on user input.
Authentication Details:

Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
Protect routes that require authentication by checking for a valid JWT.
Middleware:

Implement middleware to handle authentication checks for protected routes.
Implement error handling middleware.
Additional Considerations:

Implement input validation and sanitation for user inputs.
Implement proper error handling and logging.
Set up proper security measures, such as HTTPS.
Implement user roles and permissions for administrative access.
This is a basic outline, and depending on your specific requirements, you might need to customize and expand these APIs. Always consider security best practices and thoroughly test your system before deployment.

Signing Up, signing in and signing out of users
Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Option to add, edit, view and delete all products in the store.
Option to add items or remove items from the cart.
Create cart for each user, add and remove items from the cart and also calculate the bill.
